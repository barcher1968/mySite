        <h3>People</h3>
        <p class="people-description">As a veteran, I was trained to lead.  I have led teams as small as 3 to as large as 30.  I was recently recognized by a private equity firm as a candidate for a training course that only took 7 people from an organization of over 500.  I am a Project Management Professional and Certified Scrum Master.</p>

        <h3>Technology</h3>
        <p class="tech-description">I am a fan of all things technology.  I am currently working to become a better developer by attending a front end class for HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  I am also continuing to enhance my python skills.  I recently graduated with a degree in Computer Information Techhnology with a focus on software development.</p>
